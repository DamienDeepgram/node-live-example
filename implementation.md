## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Restructure Existing Code
- [x] Create new directory structure
- [x] Set up database.json with initial schema
- [x] Create database utility class
- [x] Split current client.js into modular components
  - [x] Extract recorder functionality into recorder.js
  - [ ] Create base navigation structure
- [x] Reorganize server.js
  - [x] Add basic routing structure
  - [x] Set up database.json handling
  - [x] Add error handling middleware

### Phase 2: Core Features Extension
- [x] Enhance existing voice transcription
  - [x] Add pause/resume to current recorder
  - [ ] Add transcription error handling
  - [ ] Implement command parsing
- [ ] Implement basic navigation between modules
- [ ] Add dark theme to existing UI

### Phase 3: Module Implementation
(Building on existing WebSocket and voice infrastructure)

#### Clinical Notes Module

- [ ] Create notes editing interface
- [x] Add notes categorization
  - [x] General Notes
  - [x] Treatment Plans
  - [x] Patient History
  - [x] Lab Results
- [ ] Implement notes search functionality
- [ ] Add notes export capability
- [ ] Create notes history view

#### Drug Dispatch Module
- [x] Add prescriptions route to server.js
- [ ] Create prescriptions.js frontend module
- [x] Implement prescription storage
- [ ] Implement voice command parsing for prescriptions
- [x] Create prescription validation system with rules:
  - [x] Required fields validation
    - [x] Medication name
    - [x] Dosage (amount and frequency)
    - [x] Duration of treatment
    - [x] Patient information
    - [x] Prescribing doctor
  - [ ] Dosage range validation

#### Scheduling Module
- [x] Add scheduling route to server.js
- [ ] Create scheduling.js frontend module
- [x] Implement appointment storage
- [x] Implement appointment scheduling logic with constraints:
  - [x] Working hours: Monday-Friday, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
  - [x] Standard appointment duration: 30 minutes
  - [x] Emergency slot availability: 2 slots per day
  - [x] Lunch break: 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM
- [ ] Add voice command parsing for dates and times
- [ ] Create appointment confirmation system
- [ ] Implement appointment reminder system
- [ ] Add conflict detection
- [x] Create appointment history view

### Data Management
- [x] Design database.json structure with schemas for:
  - [x] Clinical Notes
  - [x] Prescriptions
  - [x] Appointments
  - [x] Patient Records
  - [x] Doctor Profiles
- [x] Implement data persistence layer
  - [x] Auto-save functionality
  - [x] File-based backup system
  - [x] Data versioning

- [ ] Conduct security testing

## Database Schema (database.json)

```json
{
  "doctors": [],
  "patients": [],
  "clinicalNotes": {
    "notes": [],
    "categories": []
  },
  "prescriptions": {
    "active": [],
    "history": [],
    "templates": []
  },
  "appointments": {
    "upcoming": [],
    "past": [],
    "cancelled": []
  },
  "systemConfig": {
    "workingHours": {},
    "appointmentDurations": {},
    "backupSettings": {}
  }
}
```

## Questions Requiring Clarification:

1. Should there be a maximum duration for voice recordings?
2. Are there specific medical terminology requirements or standards to follow?
3. Should the system support multiple languages?
4. Are there specific privacy/HIPAA compliance requirements?
5. Should the system support multiple doctors/users?
6. What is the expected format for prescription details?
7. Are there specific scheduling constraints (working hours, appointment duration)?
8. Should the system integrate with any external pharmacy systems?
9. What is the required data retention period?
10. Are there specific browser/device compatibility requirements?

## Next Steps:
1. ~~Create new directory structure~~ ✓
2. ~~Set up database.json~~ ✓
3. ~~Implement database utility class~~ ✓
4. ~~Extract recorder component~~ ✓
5. ~~Create basic routing structure in server.js~~ ✓
6. Implement navigation component
7. Begin module-specific frontend implementations
