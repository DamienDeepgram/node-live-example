# Medical Transcription App

## Overview
We are building a medical transcription app that will transcribe doctor's voice and convert it into text.

The user interface is a web app that will be used by the doctor with 3 options:
- Clinacal Notes
- Drug Dispatch
- Scheduling

The UI should look professional and should be easy to use.
- Use a dark theme
- Use a modern and clean design
- Use a font that is easy to read
- Use a font that is modern and clean
- Use a font that is easy to read
- Use a font that is modern and clean

The UI should be responsive and should be able to work on any device.
- Use a responsive design
- Use a responsive font
- Use a responsive layout

The UI should support pausing and resuming the transcription.
- Use a pause button

When things are saved they should be stored in the in memory database and have a UI to view and edit them.
